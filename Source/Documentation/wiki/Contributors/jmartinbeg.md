### Personal Statement

I am drawn to real time problems and how one might employ technology to explore them.

I own www.morningglorytech.com home of Remote Batch Copy and Active IP Sensor but both are very old by now. I study C37 networks and their possibilities most of the time now and would like very much to continue in this field.
